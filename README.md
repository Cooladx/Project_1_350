Project_1_350

This is group 2 and we are working on a PostgreSQL database about [ toxicity ], of 
substances and products.

We're primarily working with this data set: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/chemicals-in-cosmetics-2a971

This dataset tracks cosmetics products sold in California that the state has found to be toxic.

This project contains:
A small python program that parses csv files into insert statements
A sql file for creating relations in a database
A sql file for inserting data into the created database
